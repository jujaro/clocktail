- status must be enum
- change the backend from a json file to ... something better. (Maybe keep old versions)
- Make the prompting more effective (no need to enter, should be able to edit existing text)
- done projects can be deleted from the database but after some time (like a week)
- we should be able to create templates of projects as many are pretty much the same.
- allow integrations or plugins so that you can automate more of the things that you do.
