- Cli tool for multitasking. All the application should be cli, with key shortcuts.
- The tool is some sort of a TODO list but instead of only presenting what is left to do, it tells you what to do at every moment and rotates
    your attention over the things that you are doing. 
- The idea is that you work on the task that the tool presents to you, you work until you either finish it or the task needs some wait time.
- Then you go back to the tool and get the next task.
- This is because many of the tasks that I do require bursts of work and large periods of idle time. I could use the idle time to 
progress in other tasks.
- You type in what you are working on at the moment (Projects) and also can add individual tasks.
- You can add (Or generate with all the information of the context) hyperlinks for each task. When the task is displayed to you, it allows you to open the hyperlink.
- You can add all the context that you want for each task, so that next time you come back you have the context in front of you.
- Some tasks can be snoozed, so that they only be displayed after some time. When you snooze a task you can tell what is it that you are waiting to continue.
- Tasks can be marked as running, waiting or done.
- At any point in time you can change the status of a task (like it was done but suddenly there is more work for it.)
